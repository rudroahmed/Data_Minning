# Data Mining Projects

Welcome to the **Data_Minning** repository! This repository contains a collection of data mining projects that demonstrate key techniques such as classification, clustering, association rule mining, and data preprocessing using Python and real-world datasets.

## 🌟 Features
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Classification Algorithms (e.g., Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, KNN)
- Clustering Techniques (e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical)
- Association Rule Mining (Apriori, FP-Growth)
- Feature Selection and Dimensionality Reduction
